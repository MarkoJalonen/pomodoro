# Pomodoro
A repo for a Pomodoro project in C/C++ and Qt.
Pomodoro is a time management method 
where the work is broken down into intervals.

Usage: 
Optionally add and remove tasks with the "Add task" and X buttons
or just use the timer for focus and relaxation periods.
You may start and stop the countdown with the play/pause button 
or skip the current countdown with the skip button.
